# DNDDB
This repository contains a Python script that showcases the effective use of Redis as a caching solution alongside PostgreSQL for persistent data storage. The script demonstrates key concepts such as cache retrieval, cache writing, and handling cache misses by fetching data from PostgreSQL.

Features
Redis Caching: Utilizes Redis for fast data retrieval to enhance performance by reducing the load on the PostgreSQL database.
PostgreSQL Integration: Leverages PostgreSQL to store and manage detailed relational data structures.
Write-Through Caching Pattern: Implements the write-through approach where data is simultaneously written to the cache and the database to ensure consistency.
Cache Miss Handling: Includes a mechanism to handle cache misses by retrieving missing data from the database and populating the cache for future requests.
